Hi, I'm Jigar, a software engineer from New Zealand, interested in helping teams deliver good software (preferably remotely).

I excel in challenging environments that require creative thinking, and I am good at getting things done. I enjoy all 
aspects of software development, and I have a track record of delivering solutions that customers love.  

If your idea can solve a problem that customers will pay for, and you need to build the tech, and the team, lets talk.

- leveraging the power of big data to deliver [life saving drugs of the future](https://www.geneious.com/biopharma/features/)

- helping a museum reach massive audiences with [digital transformation](https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/discover/collections-online/our-data)
