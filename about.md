Hi, I'm Jigar, and I like helping teams deliver good software.

I excel in challenging environments that require creative thinking, and I am good at getting things done. I enjoy all 
aspects of software development, and I have a track record of delivering solutions that customers love.  

If your idea can solve a problem that customers will pay for, and you need to build the tech, and the team, let's talk.

### Projects

Some of my notable current or past projects include:
- working with a wider government team to enhance [New Zealands covid19 contact tracing solution](https://tracing.covid19.govt.nz/)
- architecture, design and development of a cloud SaaS product, leveraging the power of big data to deliver [life saving drugs of the future](https://www.geneious.com/biopharma/features/)
- helping [Auckland Museum](https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/) reach massive audiences with an API driven approach to [digital transformation](https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/discover/collections-online/our-data)
- setting up devops practices, designing and implementing APIs for one of Australasia's fastest-growing tourism and transport companies
- customising a [project management product](https://www.digite.com/) for one of the worlds leading telecom operators
